# CompressString

Challenge:

Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, 'aabcccccaaa' would become 'a2b1c5a3'. If the compressed string would be longer than the original string, return the original string. Assume the string has only upper and lower case letters.
